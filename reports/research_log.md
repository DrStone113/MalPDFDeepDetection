## 2026-08-28 - Protocol P paper-aligned reproduction infrastructure

- Purpose: prepare reproducible, paper-aligned training infrastructure without model training.
- Added: Protocol P row-level split, feature variants, classical model factories, binary evaluation/runtime helpers, environment metadata, immutable run-output setup, CLI, and unit tests.
- Methodology: project-selected seed 42 with a 75/25 stratified row-level train/test split; no duplicate-feature grouping, tuning, multi-seed study, or cross-validation.
- Dataset: `rit-pdfmal-2026.csv`, SHA-256 `2f270ab31fbfe8821fd7f54608cb1aa694a0a8d0bbf2ca000942a68213ef8623`.
- Protocol affected: Protocol P only; Protocol G was not modified.
- Assumptions: paper seed, hyperparameters, full preprocessing details, and exact zero-variance handling are not specified; explicit project configurations are recorded per run.
- Validation: `.\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest -q` - 20 passed; manifest invariants pass on the local dataset.
- Unresolved: per-PDF hashes are absent from the local CSV, so raw-file identity cannot be verified.
- Next: run a frozen, single-seed Protocol P baseline benchmark only when explicitly requested.

## 2026-08-28 - Protocol P Benchmark Runner

- Purpose: add an executable, provenance-complete baseline runner for the paper-aligned Protocol P matrix.
- Added: saved-manifest resolver/validator, 5-model x 2-variant execution layer, timing and metrics persistence, paper-comparison table generation, failure preservation, clean-Git guard, CLI, and synthetic unit tests.
- Methodology: requires the existing seed-42 row-level 75/25 Protocol P manifest; fits only training rows and evaluates each combination once on its held-out test rows. No split regeneration, tuning, multi-seed run, threshold tuning, or cross-validation.
- Protocol affected: Protocol P only; raw CSV, Protocol G, and the paper-alignment audit are not modified.
- Assumptions: paper seed, complete hyperparameters, preprocessing details, and exact zero-variance feature treatment remain unspecified; both feature variants are reported without claiming either exactly reproduces the paper.
- Validation: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q` - 25 passed; `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip check` - no broken requirements; `git diff --check` passed.
- Results: no official 10-run benchmark has been executed; generated result reports will be produced only from the committed runner.
- Next: commit this runner, then execute one clean-worktree seed-42 benchmark when authorized.
