# MalPDFDeepDetection

A minimal Python 3.11 research project for reproducible malicious PDF detection experiments.

## Setup

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
malpdf --seed 42
```

Datasets are intentionally not downloaded by this project. Place approved samples under `data/` and follow the safety rules in `AGENTS.md`. Never execute or manually open suspicious PDFs.

## Research workflows

Create the paper-aligned Protocol P infrastructure without training models:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\prepare_protocol_p.py --seed 42
```

Each invocation creates a new immutable run directory under `data/processed/protocol_p/` and `artifacts/protocol_p/`. Protocol P is a 75/25 row-level stratified split selected by the project; it is not an exact paper reproduction because the paper does not specify every seed, hyperparameter, or preprocessing decision. The existing Protocol G feature-vector-disjoint split remains separate.

Run the frozen 5-model x 2-variant Protocol P benchmark only from a clean, committed worktree. It reuses a saved matching Protocol P manifest and refuses to generate a replacement split:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_protocol_p_benchmark.py --seed 42
```

The runner writes lightweight, commit-ready CSV/JSON/Markdown research reports to `reports/experiments/protocol_p/<run-id>/`; fitted model binaries are written only under ignored `artifacts/`. It does not tune hyperparameters, run multi-seed experiments, or perform cross-validation.
